                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>
                            StreetWare is a newfound fashion brand focusing on particular styles that are mostly
                            emo/grunge wear. One of the co-founders of the company is an app developer thus the design
                            will focus on a mobile first app approach. However the created product can be used as the
                            mobile part of a responsive webiste.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In order to develop this particular product, I chose to use the Design Thinking approach to
                            guide me through the
                            process. By following the steps, I was able to research thoroughly about the fashion
                            e-commerce industry before I
                            proceeded to analyse the problem and ultimately come up with a product solution.

                        <p>
                            Because Design Thinking emphasises the importance of human-centred design, the first step of
                            the process is to
                            empathise. This essentially gave me the opportunity to gain some insight into the thoughts,
                            feelings, and needs of the
                            users.

                        <p>
                            I conducted interviews with users who are familiar with online shopping to identify their
                            needs and pain points. Because
                            a wide range of demographics enjoys online shopping, I interviewed a total of four
                            participants between the ages of 18
                            and 50. Their professions varied from student, engineer, to homemaker.

                            was able to figure out what kind of application is going to be created and who the target
                            audience might be.

                            brainstorming ideas. With the findings I made earlier, I was able to come up with some ideas
                            in my head on how the finished product might look like. I created a number of deliverables
                            that could help me identify and visualize a solution.

                        <p>
                            I developed a task flow to show the ideal flow that the user would take to complete a task
                            in the StreetWare app. In this particular case, it focused on finding and purchasing a
                            product from the app. Working on this helped me identify the key screens for my design.

                            various paths that the user can take to complete a task. Creating this flow allowed me to
                            think from the user’s
                            perspective and consider the different options that the user has while using StreetWare's

                            Because the company is planning on creating an application for the e-commerce shop, I
                            decided to focus on developing the screens for mobile version.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            With some ideas in my mind I started to develop some wireframes for the application. With
                            some sketches by my side, I began to develop several mid-fidelity wireframes in Figma.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            These
                            wireframes include the Homepage, Category Page, Product Page, Checkout pages.
                        </p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p></p>

                        <p>
                            Because the clothes remind me of the early 2000’s and the emo / grunge aesthetic, I created
                            a mood board to reflect
                            those ideas.

                            UI Kit
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            With the inspiration from the mood board, I started creating an UI Kit that aligned with the
                            aesthetics and brand
                            identity that I was aiming for.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The main focus point was the big bold black and white, however when it came to color, the
                            accent had to be a strong pink to match the "emoish" aesthetic.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The models are being photographed in front of various colored backgrounds, these colors go
                            from purple, red, yellow, pink etc. As this is something I do not have control over, I tried
                            to match the color palette with the physical colors.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            For instance if the model is standing in front of a purple background, the size indicators
                            are going to match the backround.

                            the final design as it can get, however it still gives me the opportunity to evaluate

                            If needed, I would have to do another round of iteration and testing. Once these steps are
                            complete, I can hand off the project to the developers.

                                in which each of the steps could be used to help develop the final product.

                            As this was my first clothing application I made it was interesting how I would incorporate
                            some of the fashion aspects into my design thinking.
                            I feel like the product turned out to be user friendly and kept the emo/grunge aesthetic in
                            the design. Even though I am satisfied with the product I made I feel like there can be
                            multiple imrovements in the future in the application, that would make the experience even
                            better.
