                    <p>
                        Shark Cinema is little family owned cinema in the heart of the city. The cinema’s
                        website/application provides an easy solution to check what is playing right now,
                        book Movie tickets and seats in advance, furthermore to but snacks even before entering the
                        cinema to avoid queues.

                    <h2>The Problem</h2>
                    <p>
                        Smaller movie theaters do not have responsive websites thus making it hard to know what is
                        playing at the moment.
                        <br>
                        Paying for the tickets and snacks right before the movie starts can be a long and tiring
                        process.

                    <p>
                        Design a responsive website to be user friendly. Create a user-flow that allows the user to book
                        seats and buy snacks in advance.

                        This app aims to provide a user friendly experience. A primary user group identified through
                        research was young adults who do not want to spend a long time in the queue before a movie.

                        reservation process even before entering the cinema, thus they want to get everything ready in
                        the comfort of their own home.

                    <p>
                        I learned that user research can deeply benefit the creation of the website making process.
                        Furthermore, using visually pleasing colors, fonts and images help to engage users’ attention.
