                            After Establishing StartupCentral’s brand identity and the new homepage design <a href="#"
                                class="link">(You can see it here)</a>, the company strives to expand and improve
                            itself. The company
                            wants to be
                            the hub for the entrepreneurs and wants to create a Social Media site where these
                            entrepreneurs
                            can interact and connect with eachother.

                        <h2>The Problem</h2>
                        <p>
                            People always try to be in a community, as a small entrepreneur or business owner,
                            unfortunately
                            there is no such website that could fill this gap. The closest to what people have for this
                            is LinkedIn and Facebook
                            however these social media giants they are too broad and do not keep the small businesses in
                            focus.

                        <p>
                            As the userbase have most likely used Facebook/Linkedin the company would like to go with a
                            similar design to give
                            the userbase familiarity to use the site.

                        <p>
                            As for now the company does not have a clear goal what the site will offer, or how it is
                            going to function in the long run,
                            while Establishing the foundation for the site; we have to create different designs and
                            assets, even some that are not even
                            going to see the day of light.

                            As a to-be social media, the company wants to engage the userbase with various events, and
                            posts, to make them discuss
                            and network with eachother.

                            As the userbase was previously established during the home site redesign, we can assume that
                            the people who would use the main site, would also be the members of the community.

                        <p>
                            When creating early concepts, a 3 column design was in focus just as with other SoMe giatns.
                            For the main webiste.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            For a Social Media site a newsfeed reel, messaging and profile page are the most important.
                            As we would like the userbase to interact with eachother they will have to have the means
                            for it to do so.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Some early concepts and design ideas can be seen below.

                        <p>
                            The site wants to users to know wether they are logged in to the site, or they are still
                            just on the main page.
                            <br>
                            After logging in the plan was to seperate the user experience. In order to show this
                            distinction
                            all accross the pages the easiest solution is to change the navigation bar, as it is always
                            present.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Moreover some of the sites do not have to be in focus as we can assume some helper pages,
                            such as what the site offers will be redundant as signed up users already know that kind of
                            information.

                            As for the profile page, we wanted the users to give their own personal touch to it, to feel
                            more involved. The users can choose their own profile picture and cover image, furthermore
                            they can update
                            their information that sits right below the cover image.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Under the user information and pictures, there are 2 columns that describe the users'
                            business. These descriptions and information can also be updated.

                            Unfortunately there are certain aspects that can make or break a project. In this case, I as
                            the Designer
                            of the site do not consider the project complete, as I had to work on it in a thight
                            deadline and cutting corners in some places were a must.
                            <br>
                            I think it is important to respect deadlines, not only for the developers but for the CEO as
                            well.

                            During the project there can be many misunderstandings, clear conversation is key to
