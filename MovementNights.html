                            Movement Nights is an event organisation company based in Hungary. They focus mostly on
                            providing experiences for
                            younger audiences and
                            Their proprietary software enables users to create events by selecting venues and artists.
                            Currently, this software is
                            dedicated to event management.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the company has expanded they started organising events in a
                            bigger volume, moreover they
                            also started providing the
                            beverages for the events. To support this growth Movement Nights
                            would like to integrate an
                            analytics tool for their
                            software to help effectively monitor their income and expenses.

                            To actually input/update the date shown on the overview page the user will have to navigate
                            to
                            the income report tab.
                            Here the user can easily input the data necessary for the financial analytics. The first 3
                            columns can be edited by the
                            user, the “Revenue” and the “Net income” columns are calculated automatically. Revenue is
                            calculated by multiplying the
                            amount sold and the price of the beverage, while the Net Income comes from putting the 27%
                            tax
                            rate on the revenue. To
                            make the page more intuitive, in the right column a card indicates the top selling
                            beverages.
                        </p>
                        <p>


                            By clicking on the “Add beverage” button, the system creates a new row for the given
                            beverage.
                            The beverage and the
                            quantity specification can be picked from a dropdown menu, while the amount sold, and the
                            price
                            can be written manually.
                            When the user is done inputting the data they can confirm it by clicking on the checkmark.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Switching to the tickets tab, the user receives a similar layout just like the one with the
                            beverages. The rows are added and updated the same way, and the calculations for revenue and
                            net income are also the same. Rather than showcasing the top salling beverages the right
                            column switches to indicate the amount of tickets sold, moreover a small indicator also
                            shows the amount of tickets sold for the previous event at the same location.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The “Expense reports” page follows the same structure. The user can add different labour
                            costs, set the multipliers
                            and adjust the labour expenses to get the total expense. With the dropdown above the table,
                            the user can change from
                            labour costs to beverage expenses.
                        </p>

                            After the user is done adding the various income and expense reports they can adjust the
                            status by clicking the dropdown menu in the top right corner
                        </p>
