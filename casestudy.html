                        <p>StartupCentral is a benefit club for entrepreneurs that focuses on client relationships and
                            partner deals
                            with other firms. The premise of the company is to create an online social platform where
                            entrepreneurs can find help and information about starting and managing a business no matter
                            whether
                            they just want to start, or they have already started the process</p>

                        <h2> An elegant design.</h2>
                        <p>
                            As the <span class="t-acc">Front-end Developer</span>, I was responsible of building the
                            entire UI for the new website,
                            redefining the User Experience and studying new interactions between the User and the
                            Interface.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The process started by creating wireframes and UI components in <span class="t-acc">Adobe
                                Xd</span> first with the home page, then the Blog and the SoMe page respectively.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For this project, a <span class="t-acc">CSS Framework</span> has been written in <span
                                class="t-acc">SASS</span> for
                            easier content creation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the previous website, the company received complaints how the site was not user friendly,
                            furthermore people were unsubscribing from the service as they did not know, where they
                            could potentially find relevant information or how they could register.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These issues have been adressed as now the userbase can find the register button easily
                            thanks to the 'sizzling-red' colored register buttons, that gives a nice accent on the
                            blue/white background colors.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The main 'space-cadet' blue button provides
                            information through the site.

                        <p>
                            StartupCentral is also a home for entrepreneurial news articles and
                            blog posts. As part of the re-design the blog should contain the same colors so the userbase
                            should be able to associate the different layout with the color scheme.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            On the blog site a card layout welcomes the user to easily identify the different articles.
                            The latest blog is bigger than the others and next to it a collection of the most popular
                            and the staff favourites take place.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The topic of the blog is indicated by the 'sizzling-red' accent color and by clicking on it
                            it takes the user to a collective page where only certain topics will show up.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The Blog article (picture on the right) features the blog post on the left side of the
                            users' screen, and on the right shows the most popular and the staff favourites as well.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            After the user reads the blog, 3 other blogs similar to the original are shown under the
                            article to keep the user on the site. Under the three articles a category selector can be
                            seen where each category is indicated with a different color.

                        <h2>Social Media Page</h2>
                        <p>
                            For the SoMe page a distinction was necessary as some of the users were complaining that
                            they never knew whether they were logged in on the page or not. To make it clear for the
                            user the logged in User Interface has been completely differentiated from the guest website.
                            <br><br>
                            Starting with the navigation bar, the color of the navbar has been changed to white and the
                            initial text buttons have been changed to quick buttons with infographics on top.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This new navigation bar ensures that the content and help the user is looking for can be
                            easily found and only the relevant buttons are shown for an easier access. If the user is
                            lacking some information about a certain topic, the informative pages can still be found
                            under the 'Menu' tab.
                            <br><br>
                            When the user is logged in the initial home page changes into an informative profile page.
                            This page consists of 3 seperate columns. In the left row the user sees their name and a
                            small welcome message, in the middle a newsfeed like column can be seen with concise
                            information about what the user can and able to do by logging in, moreover the three latest
                            blogs.
                            <br>
                            In the right column the user can get a quick glance of the various offers, the newest
                            partners, and the newest coaches on the website.
                            <br>
                            <br>
