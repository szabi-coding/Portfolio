                    <br>
                    <p>
                        There are many applications to keep track of different accounts, account balances, upcoming
                        bills, insurances, investments, etc.
                        <br>
                        An average user would have to download three or four
                        applications just to keep track of everything.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Stonks Capital is planning to solve the issue of having multiple different applications,
                        creating one that the user can input all their data thus making it easier to keep track of
                        investments and finances.

                    <p>
                        Design an easy to use mobile app experience. Create a user-flow that allows the user to see
                        their portfolios at glance and check their balances on their different accounts.

                        Interviews were conducted based on which empathy maps were created to understand users. <br>
                        The app prioritises users between the age group of 25-40 after identification through research.
                        <br>
                        These people are the most likely to use an application that keeps track of their balances as
                        they are the most money conscious user group.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This group confirmed that these people are the ones that are most likely technically advanced
                        enough to use these kinds of apps and sync their data. Furthermore they want to be sure about
                        their balances quickly and at a glance.

                        In the low-fidelity prototype I connected all of the screens involved into a primary user flow.
                        The user can navigate easily between their accounts, bills, and investments.

                        it was also important to have the user be able to check individual spendings, furthermore to
