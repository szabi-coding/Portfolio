                            within COOP-affiliated stores
                            such as Coop365, Superbrugsen, Irma etc. moreover to provide deals and discounts for
                            recurring users. It offers deals
                            and discounts for recurring users, informs them about news and new recipes to incentivize
                            shopping, and enables users to

                            This case study centres on the redesign of the Coop application, proposing a refurbished
                            design system that appears more
                            modern yet remains neutral enough for easy scalability and future development. The focus is
                            on the main pages accessible
                            to free users, omitting pages that require membership. It is worth noting that due to a lack
                            of contact with the
                            development team, I'm not aware of the existing app's software limitations. This project was
                            conducted in my own free
                            time.

                        <h2>The Problem</h2>
                        <p>
                            The home screen has not had a large visual makeover since the launch 6 years ago. All that
                            was done is to add further
                            complexity to support the requests from the retailers. What should the future home screen
                            look like to give a modern and
                            scalable Look & Feel for each of our retail clients, while showing the relevant information
                            and make customers ready to
                            start a shopping trip when they enter the store?

                        <p>
                            The commercial requirement is to increase the flexibility for each of our retail clients, so
                            each home screen does not
                            have to look alike.The dashboard “blobs” don’t need to be in the centre of attention and the
                            feed could be grouped into
                            different categories. The Bonus increases every time you shop and we would still like to see
                            the incremental amount when
                            you open the app after a successful shopping experience.

                        <h2>High Fidelity Design</h2>
                        <h3>Navigation Bar</h3>
                        <p>
                            "The old Navigation bar features 5 buttons: 'Home,' 'Discounts,' 'Scan,' 'Shopping list,'
                            and 'More' respectively. While
                            brainstorming and reconsidering the design, I came to the conclusion that relocating the
                            'More' button would create room for other,
                            more useful feature buttons such as recipes."
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            As the main focus of the application is the 'scan and go' feature in the shop, the new
                            design highlights the scanning
                            button prominently on the navigation bar. This button is larger for easier access and more
                            visibility. The other main
                            features of the application, such as 'recipes,' 'discounts,' and 'shopping list,' are also
                            emphasized. Previously,
                            recipes were not accessible through a button; they were only featured on the home page in
                            one of the blobs. In the new
                            design, recipes have a dedicated button on the bottom navigation bar, alongside the
                            'discounts' and 'shopping list'
                            buttons."

                        <p>

                            The “More” button has been moved to a newly created top navigation bar and has been replaced
                            with a hamburger menu icon.
                            This top navigation bar also features a welcome message on the left side, and a “Newspaper”
                            icon next to the “hamburger
                            menu” icon, taking the user to a newly created newsfeed page. You can read more about this
                            page later in the study.

                        <h3>Home Page</h3>
                        <p>
                            The old home page layout features several blobs in the middle of the screen. While the blobs
                            are visually appealing and
                            potentially more engaging, they could be considered to have a higher cognitive load due to
                            the variety of font sizes and
                            less traditional layout, which may slightly hinder the immediate finding of information. It
                            is also important to mention
                            that occasionally, additional blobs may push the existing ones halfway out of the screen
                            which creates a cluttered
                            appearance and affects the overall user experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The central and prominent button shows the amount of money acquired for the membership.
                            “Ugends tilbud” and “Appris” buttons only take the user to the discounts page, duplicating
                            the functionality already available, thus making them unnecessary clutter on the interface.
                            Additionally, the other half of the screen is occupied by the latest blog posts, creating
                            confusion regarding the user's focus. Maximizing the blog post section could help clarify
                            the user's navigation experience."

                        <p>In the redesigned version the main function of the home page is to let the user quickly
                            access information about
                            their savings, discover the latest discounts, see the latest newspaper articles of various
                            shops, and explore the
                            latest recipes, all without navigating to a different page. The approach is to display deals
                            with clear pricing and
                            savings information that can make decision-making easier for the user. Savings are
                            prominently highlighted, clearly
                            indicating to the user the amount they can save by using the app, thereby serving as a
                            strong incentive for
                            purchasing a membership.</p>
                        <p>
                            The focus remains on the amount saved up for the membership, emphasising the importance
                            of showing users their progress towards membership benefits. In this version the user
                            also receives additional information about how much more is needed for their membership,
                            moreover an extra button that by clicking provides more information about the membership
                            and the benefits, to convey a clearer message.

                                    information about these discounts if they are already members. Therefore, a CTA
                                    button for becoming a member is included on the card.

                                    published. However, the cards on the home page are designed to be more concise
                                    compared to those on the actual recipes page layout, reducing clutter.

                        <p>
                            The newsfeed is a newly introduced page that wasn't available in the original application.
                            Its purpose is to streamline the home page layout by displaying only relevant discounts and
                            new recipes at first glance for the user. The page is accessed by clicking the “Newspaper
                            Icon” on the top navigation bar. In order to inform the users that a new recipe/article has
                            been posted, a red notification badge appears on the top right of the icon. To show that the
                            user has clicked on the icon and is on the newsfeed, the Navigation menu’s text changes;
                            moreover the icon is highlighted by a white colour.

                        <p>The first section of the newsfeed highlights the ongoing campaigns, which may include prizes
                            that users can win or raffles they can participate in.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The newsfeed is organised into content cards, each offering a different recipe or
                            suggestion. This card-based layout
                            allows for easy scrolling and content consumption. They kept the same layout and they have
                            been updated a bit to
                            match the Kolibri design system. Small enhancements have been implemented on the cards for
                            improved usability.

                            A new
                            feature is an icon placed in the top right corner of each card, indicating whether the post
                            is a recipe or an
                            article. Additionally the old design’s buttons were sometimes taking the user outside of the
                            app into their browser
                            to read the article, without being clear of the action. Now, icons added to these buttons
                            provide clear indication
                            of the action, ensuring users are informed before navigating away from the app.

                        <h3> Savings Account</h3>
                        <p>
                            The savings account page was kept similar to its original version. This page is accessible
                            by clicking the first
                            main card on the Kolibri homepage that indicates the amount saved up for the membership.
                            Upon opening this page, the
                            navigation bar changes from the original blue one, to show a different icon instead of the
                            hamburger menu. By
                            clicking this “question mark” icon the user can read more about how the savings and the
                            membership account actually
                            works.
                        </p>

                        <p>The main changes on the page include the addition of a circular progress bar and the
                            "Progression for bonuses"
                            section. These updates effectively communicate the user's progress and the remaining goals,
                            which is excellent for
                            user motivation. The app incentivizes users to become members and save money by showing
                            potential earnings and
                            savings over time, which can encourage continued use of the app.</p>

                        <p>
                            On the progression card, the app now indicates the remaining time the user has to earn the
                            1% discount for the given
                            period.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The “Bonuses Earned” categories have also been sectioned and the font sizes of the amount of
                            money saved have also been increased for a clearer experience.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The old design of the recipes page features two tabs, where the user can see all the recipes
                            or the recipes that they favourite. It also has a search box and cards featuring the image
                            and name of the dish, users can also mark dishes as favourites using a heart icon, adding
                            them into the favourites section.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            On the actual recipe page, there's a starring system allowing users to rate recipes from 0
                            to 5 stars. To enhance user experience, this feature has been integrated into the cards on
                            the recipe page. Now, users can see the rating of each dish before clicking on it, providing
                            valuable insight into its popularity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The cards on the recipe page could also display the number of ingredients required for each
                            dish. Additionally, a convenient quick action button could be included on the cards,
                            allowing users to quickly add the necessary ingredients to their shopping basket with just
                            one click.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When opening the recipe page, the navigation bar transitions from the default one to a
                            customized version featuring "back," "share," and "like" buttons. The addition of the
                            sharing option encourages user engagement by enabling them to easily share recipes,
                            potentially attracting more users to the app.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The page prominently displays the name of the dish, the recipe rating, and an image
                            accompanied by relevant tags for better categorization.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The serving counter has been relocated beneath the image and positioned between "-" and "+"
                            buttons for simpler
                            adjustment.

                        <p>
                            Directly below the ingredients section, a button allows users to add all the ingredients to
                            their shopping list. As users scroll further down, they can read the directions of the
                            recipe, making it easier to follow along. To ensure proper readability and easy access, the
                            button to add all ingredients to the shopping list remains on the screen in a minimized
                            version.

                        <h3>Discounts</h3>
                        <p>

                            The discounts page maintains its original layout while incorporating updated cards. A
                            carousel is positioned just below
                            the navigation bar, allowing users to scroll through their favorite shops and explore the
                            latest discounts and
                            newspapers.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            The updated discount cards prominently feature the secondary color, primarily in a CTA
                            format, enabling users to
                            immediately sign up for a membership. In the previous design, the "Become a member" button
                            was occasionally hidden from
                            view, potentially going unnoticed by users.

                            Upon clicking the "See all" button, the page dynamically changes. Instead of the top
                            carousel displaying store icons,
                            users can scroll through all available Newspapers, App Prices, Personal Discounts, and more.

                            all the activated discounts. Unlike the old version where the cards disappeared after
                            activation, in the redesigned
                            version, the card remains visible, however the button transitions to a greyish colour to
                            indicate its inactive
                            state.

                            The first page of the scanning tab remains largely similar to the original design. However,
                            a small enhancement has been made to improve usability by enlarging the rounded buttons,
                            transforming them into bigger tiles. This adjustment enhances readability and clickability,
                            ensuring a smoother user experience.

                            The primary issue with the scanner page is its lack of clarity. Even after purchasing just
                            two items, the basket items are already pushed off the screen, making it difficult for users
                            to see and understand how many products are in the basket. With each new input, users must
                            maximise the screen to view the contents of the basket.
                        </p>

                            The updated scanner page features a slightly smaller scanner screen, allowing more space for
                            the basket and shopping list tabs. This enlarged area accommodates bigger fonts and buttons,
                            enhancing accessibility and providing a clearer interface.

                            Upon successfully scanning an
                            item, the white bracket of the scanner turns green, accompanied by a checkmark to
                            indicate
                            the successful scan. After the interaction the item will be visible in the basket.

                            The

                            side
                            for easier accessibility. In this state the application also shows the individual item

                        <p>
                            Additionally, a delete button has been incorporated to allow users to easily remove an
                            item from their basket. Unlike the previous version where users could only remove
                            multiple items at once by clicking the minus button multiple times, this new feature
                            provides more flexibility.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For easier removal a gesture control is added, where the user can slide the item to the
                            left side for deletion. After this action a modal pops up to ensure that no items are
                            deleted by accidental swipes. A text button is also added under the basket items, for
                            instances where the user might want to remove all basket items at once.
                            even if multiple of the same had been added before.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Furthermore, a text button has been added below the basket items for instances where
                            users may want to remove all basket items at once, even if multiple of the same item had
                            been added previously.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            When purchasing
                            items
                            such as bottled drinks with a deposit fee, the deposit price is now indicated right
                            under
                            the item name for clarity.

                        <p>
                            Just like in the previous version the user can easily switch between the basket tab and the
                            shopping list tab. Further
                            details regarding the shopping list update are available for review later in the study,
                            providing a more explanation.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            After proceeding to the checkout page, the user can see the total amount they have to pay
                            for the products, moreover
                            they can set up different payment methods in advance and choose which one to use for their
                            payment. Sliding the
                            Payment arrow prompts the user to the “Payment Approved” screen displaying the QR code with
                            which the user can leave
                            the store. The final page of this flow includes the logo and a gratitude message aimed at
                            increasing customer
                            loyalty.

                        <h3>Shopping List</h3>
                        <p>
                            The shopping list page greets users with an image of a shopping basket and accompanying text
                            that explains the
                            purpose of the page and provides guidance on how to add items to their grocery list.
                            Pressing the plus icon opens up the "Add Item" page, where users can see a list of the most
                            frequently added items.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Pressing an item in the row, such as "egg," triggers a modal to appear where users can
                            refine and modify the item's
                            details on their list. This includes the ability to change the name, category, and quantity
                            of the item. In the
                            original version, this modal only appeared after an item had already been added to the list
                            and the user wished to
                            modify it. For users who prefer to quickly add items to their list without a modal popping
                            up, a plus icon at the
                            end of the row provides that option.
                        </p>
                        <p></p>
                        <img src="src/assets/images/Kolibri/Shopping List - 1.png" alt="kolibrishopping" class="zoom">
                        <p></p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>
                            The previously added items are categorised into segments on the page, such as "fruits,"
                            "dairy products," "meat," etc.
                            Each item row displays the added item, its quantity next to a checkbox, and the exact shop
                            where the product is
                            purchasable. However, this feature is only available when the user adds the item from a
                            newspaper. (This feature already
                            exists in the original application, but it has not been addressed in this project.)
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Functionality-wise, gestured options for "Delete" and "Checked" have been added. Users can
                            access these options by
                            dragging a selected row either to the left or the right side, respectively. Additionally, at
                            the end of each row, a
                            four-dotted indicator allows users to drag and drop items on the list for easier
                            rearrangement, enhancing the user
                            experience.
                            After a user checks out an item from the list, a previously hidden section called "Your
                            Basket" appears. Here, users
                            can easily view the items already added to the basket, which are checked and crossed out.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The gesture and arrangement controls are visible in the design however as the software
                            limitations are unknown during the creation of this project, the possibility of the
                            implementation of these options are not certain.
                        </p>

                            application or take them to their browser.

                        <p>
                            The case study presents a comprehensive redesign of the Coop application, aimed at enhancing
                            user experience and
                            modernising the interface while addressing the specific requirements and challenges outlined
                            in the problem statement.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The redesign focuses on several key areas, including the home page, newsfeed, savings
                            account, recipes, discounts,
                            scanning, shopping list, and settings. Each section undergoes careful consideration and
                            refinement to optimise
                            usability, clarity, and functionality.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The solution involves reorganising the layout to prioritise relevant information such as
                            savings, discounts,
                            recipes, and news. Additionally, the addition of dedicated buttons for key features like
                            recipes and discounts
                            enhances accessibility and usability.
                        </p>

                                Iterative design thrives on user feedback. While this project relied primarily on my own
                                assessments, a broader range of
                                user input would lead to a less biased and more refined interface.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Redesigning an entire application requires careful
                                consideration of various components,
                                including navigation, layout, functionality, and visual design, to ensure a
                                user-friendly experience.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Allocating more time to the project would undoubtedly lead to superior outcomes.
                                Developing a fully functional prototype would allow for extensive user engagement,
                                enabling valuable feedback on the usability, functionality, and overall user experience
                                of the redesigned interface.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                            <p>
                                Overall, the redesign successfully addresses the challenges outlined in the problem
                                statement by improving
                                usability, clarity, and functionality across key areas of the application. By
                                modernising
                                the interface and
                                optimising user experience, the redesigned Coop application is better equipped to meet
                                the
                                needs of its diverse user
                                base and provide a seamless shopping experience.
