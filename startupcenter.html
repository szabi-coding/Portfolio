                        partner deals
                        with other firms. The premise of the company is to create an online social platform where
                        entrepreneurs can find help and information about starting and managing a business no matter
                        whether
                        they just want to start, or they have already started the process</p>

                    <p>
                        Starting your own company is a hard task.
                        <br>
                        Finding all the information to start your own business, shop, company etc. can be exhausting and
                        often people cannot seem to find the right sources. StartupCenter would like to create an
                        experience where the users can find all their information furthermore get coaching and benefits
                        from various partners.

                    <p>
                        Design a responsive website to be user friendly. Create a user-flow that allows the user to find
                        coaches for their liking, furthermore to find the best partners and discounts for their business
                        ideas.

                        started their business.

                        own business

                        In the low-fidelity prototype I connected all of the screens involved into a primary user flow.
                        The user can choose the coach page, and from there he can go to the coaches' personal pages.

                        <br>
                        The company desperately needed a design system for easier implementations as
                        the company
                        strives to expand in the future.
                        This new design system will help in the extension of the company
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moreover Startupcentral needed to establish a new company color for easier
                        brand recognition
                        and a full color-palette that goes with it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The designs have went through at least 30 iterations per screen.
                        It is due to several
                        reasons: Change in business direction, shift in
                        product roadmap or simply to
                        improve the user experience.

                        I learned that making many iterations for a website is harder than I initially thought it would

                        screen sizes and gesturing on the site into consideration a lot more than we think.
