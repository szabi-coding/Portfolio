                        <p>
                            StartupCenter is a benefit club for entrepreneurs that focuses on client relationships and
                            partner deals with other firms. The premise of the company is to create an online social
                            platform where entrepreneurs can find help and information about starting and managing a
                            business no matter whether they just want to start, or they have already started the process
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In this Project, we revamped the user experience and redesigned the UI, which is one of the
                            largest project at StartupCentral since the foundation.

                        <p>
                            The dropoff rate on the website was high. Due to the low usage, we never prioritized
                            improving on or building new
                            features for the website.

                        <p>
                            It has not gone through a redesign for over 2 years. The design language is not consistent
                            through the website. The onld landing page shows only blue and white colors and there are no
                            distinct buttons that would indicate where the user should click.

                        <p>
                            Startupcentral needs to establish a new company color for easier brand recognition and a
                            full color-palette that goes with it. Establishing what colors should be used and where
                            should be used will subconsciously tell the users where they can gather information.

                            Before the designing process, we deep dive into getting to know the userbase. We also
                            conducted a series of customer interviews.
                            <br>
                            We focused on identifying who are the main users that use our product.

                            This is how the some of the early wireframes looked like. After revamping the home page the
                            main focus was put on the coaches, the partners and the explanation page. The designs went
                            through
                            many iterations before the team decided on the final concept.

                            In the low-fidelity prototype I connected all of the screens involved into a primary user

                            The same can be said for the partners, as it is easy to navigate back and forth for

                        <p>
                            The company desperately needed a design system for easier implementations as the company
                            strives to expand in the
                            future. This new design system will help in the extension of the company
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Moreover Startupcentral needed to establish a new company color for easier brand recognition
                            and a full color-palette that goes with it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The designs have went through at least 30 iterations per screen. It is due to several
                            reasons: Change in business direction, shift in product roadmap or simply to improve the
                            user experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here is an early snippet of the established design system

                        <p>
                            Before the redesign, there was a lack of focus on what, StartupCentral offers. The website
                            was cluttered some places, it was giving vague information and there was no clear indication
                            where the user can get meaningful information.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Here's a detailed walkthrough of what I improved post-testing
                        </p>
                        <h3>Home page update</h3>
                        <p>
                            The hero image has been changed to indicate a network of danish entrepreneurs as that is
                            what the company wants to stand for.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After that as there was no indication for the user where to start or, where he could get
                            more information
                            about the product.
                            <br>
                            In the updated version of the site there is a clear userflow and explanation. The
                            first section gives a small intro, and then the sections following explain more and possibly
                            lead the user further on the page.
