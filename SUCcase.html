                        <p>
                            StartupCentral is a benefit club for entrepreneurs that focuses on client relationships and
                            partner deals with other
                            firms. The premise of the company is to create an online social platform where entrepreneurs
                            can find help and
                            information about starting and managing a business no matter whether they just want to
                            start, or they have already
                            started the process.

                            In this Project, we revamped the user experience and redesigned the UI, which is one of the
                            largest projects at
                            StartupCentral since the foundation.

                        <p>
                            The conversion rate was low and the drop off rate was high on the old website. Due to low
                            usage, the company never
                            prioritised improving on or building new features for the website. The users did not
                            understand how they can use the
                            discounts for the partners and how to contact the mentors.

                        <p>
                            Startupcentral needs to establish a proper company colour for easier brand recognition and a
                            full colour-palette that
                            goes with it. Establishing what colours should be used and where should be used will
                            subconsciously tell the users where
                            they can gather information.

                            Because design thinking emphasises the importance of human-centered design, the first step

                            emphasise. This essentially gives me the chance to gain insight about the thoughts,

                            got from the previous steps it was time to think of a visualisation of

                        <p>
                            The company desperately needed a design system for easier implementations as the company
                            strives to expand in the future. This new design system will help in the extension of the
                            company

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Moreover Startupcentral needed to establish a new company color for easier brand recognition
                            and a full color-palette that goes with it.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            The designs have went through at least 30 iterations per screen. It is due to several
                            reasons: Change in business direction, shift in product roadmap or simply to improve the
                            user experience.

                            Considered as a final step in the design thinking process it focuses on testing the final
                            high-fidelity prototype. It is a process that helps me evaluate the job I have done, whether
                            the new design solves the problem or not, or if I need to redesign some aspects of the new
                            sites or not.

                            The usability testing was conducted using the high-fidelity desktop prototype. The main

                            the users would adapt to the change of the layout. The test was also used to see whether the
                            design solves the users’ needs and pain points defined during the research phase.

                            Before the redesign, there was a lack of focus on what, StartupCentral offers. The website
                            was cluttered some places, it was giving vague information and there was no clear indication
                            where the user can get meaningful information.

                            After that as there was no indication for the user where to start or, where he could get
                            more
                            information about the product.

                            In the updated version of the site there is a clear userflow and explanation. The first
                            section
                            gives a small intro, and then the sections following explain more and possibly lead the user
                            further on the page.
                        </p>

                            Reading on, the user gets to know about the prices of the service, furthermore a clear
                            indication is shown which price window is the most valuable as it is emphasized with a

                            The "sizzling red" will always take the user to the register page and the "spacecadet blue"
                            button takes the user to get more information about the product.

                            The partners and coaches now are also distinguisheable. The partners site shows 3 columns,
                            with more detailed information plus the benefits they provide.

                            The individual coach page was missing information sometimes, furthermore it was hard to
                            read, thus providing an
                            uneasy user experience.

                            While the company page was a better made in the original design, to keep the design

                            The target audiance was happy about the re-design. They could find the information a lot

                            Recreating the main site is only the first step of a huge process and change at
                            StartupCentral.
                            As StartupCentral would like to establish a Social Media like network, laying the foundation
                            on the main site can
                            partly determine the success of the network.

                            Creating a visual hierarchy and a color system can significantly improve brand identity. By
                            using the original
                            colors throughout multiple sites that are all connected to StartupCentral, the user
                            subconsciously links them
                            together, even without the indication of a logo.

                            We needed to stay grounded and focused on the goal, but also account for changes to the
                            product to match the changed behavior of customers.

                            We learned to break down complicated designs into small, manageable chunks. This eases
